							Hi, I'm Maria, a Data Analyst in the making. 
							I love to be around nature and to read, specially Haruki Murakami. I am also a very creative person. I love to play with my cat and to have a nice cup of coffee.
							I love learning. Every day I observe something new and like to wonder how it works, whether that be about data, math, or human behaviour, I think the physicist inside of me loves to put a bit of math in everything. 
							Lastly, I'm incredibly lucky in life, I love the family I've built and the home I come to every night.

							<h2>Skills and Interests</h2>

						<div class="content">
							<font size="+1.0">
							
							<p>I have built some skills over time,  <b>you can check out my cv <a href="Maria_Santos_CV_1.pdf" target="_blank" > here</a></b>.</p>
							<p>As for interest I have so many really, but here are some that have impacted my work:</p>
							<ul class="feature-icons">
								<li class="icon solid fa-network-wired"> Automation and extraction APIs</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-chart-bar"> Cohort Analysis</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-fingerprint"> Human repetitive behaviour</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-money-check"> IAP optimisation</li>
							</ul>
							
							<p>Working in the gaming industry was a dream of mine, specially in mobile games as they have to archive a very delicaded balance to retain and entertain users. 
							Every sunday I had the ritual of downloading some f2p game and dive into it the next week. I believe I've played 100+ games throughout the past few years. 
							You can checkout some of my favourite games here.</p>

						<div class="content">
							<!-- Section -->
								<section>
									<header>
										<h3>Covid-19 World Data</h3>
										<p>A visualization of Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths around the World using <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>SQL</strong> and <strong>Power BI</strong>.</p>
									</header>
									<div class="content">
										When I realised I wanted to start a data analysis career I did 3 projects to start showing my skills. I thought that they were just going to add value to my CV, but surprised I was when doing these projects I started learning so much more, not about skills, but about who I was when looking at data.

									<header>
										<h3>Deep Learning </h3>
											<p>Identify different types of flowers using <strong>PyTorch</strong>'s and <strong>Deep Learning</strong>. Currently on progress.</p>
									</header>
									<div class="content">
										I discovered I like to trace human behaviour, to understand how we all create habits that aren't so different from each other. That surprised me, I always thought of myself as a unique human with unique habits, but reality is our habits are partially shapped by our external signals and when you look at a population you see people share so much in terms of behaviour.

									<header>
										<h3>Web Scrapping Amazon</h3>
											<p>Web Scrapping Amazon searches using <strong>Python</strong>'s library: <strong>BeautifulSoup</strong>.</p>
									</header>
									<div class="content">
										Another thing, I realised I really like the process of fecthing data: web scrapping, APIs and real-time data, all of them have intricacies that make them so powerfull and usefull. You can check the journey of these past projects down below:										<p></p>

							<h2>Hobbies</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p> Reading, painting, cooking or baking, I love to do so many things! 
								I could have a whole gallery of things but this picture warms my heart.
								I spent the whole day making pasta from morning to evening. 
								The whole kitchen was a white with flour, even the cat got some of it! 
								But the best part is having my beloved boyfriend helping me clean everything when I get tired, making jokes together of how everytime he cleans the whole house I immediatly make pasta. There is really no logic in that right?!  </p>
